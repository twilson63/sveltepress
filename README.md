# static press

A static site generator using markdown, and sveltejs as the templates. Mainly focused on creating a simple blog site, but could be modified to support any kind of static site.

* modify your Blog and Post svelte components for look and feel, run `yarn build` to generate your static site, then run `yarn dev` to see your static site on port 3000, finally run `yarn deploy` to push the site now.
